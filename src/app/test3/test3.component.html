<h1>Test 3</h1>

<p>
  Improve component performance
</p>

<p>
  There is an issue with this page. Data is fetched from the server every 5 seconds,
  but whenever new data is fetched, it takes the browser about 1.5s to render all of the rows.
  This is because of a heavy calculation that is done in the HeavyComponent that it renders for each row.
</p>

<p>
  Accepting the fact that the calculation must by done at least once for each row, so the initial load will
  remain slow how can we make sure that subsequent updates do not retrigger this calculation
  <em>without changing HeavyComponent</em> and <em>without making changes to the <code>rows$</code>
  observable or its source</em>?
</p>

<div>
  <div *ngFor="let row of rows$|async">
    <app-heavy [row]="row"></app-heavy>
  </div>
</div>
