<h1>Test 2</h1>

<p>
  Create a search input that triggers an API call
</p>

<p>
  The API call should go to: https://600fe4d46c21e1001704f951.mockapi.io/Search
</p>

<p>
  When typing, the API call should only trigger after the user has not typed
  anything for 500ms. While an API call is running, a loading indicator should
  appear. When the API call is not running, it should show the response from the
  API call (which will always be the same)
</p>

<div>
  Search
  <input type="text" name="search" #search (input)="onSearchInputChange(search.value)" placeholder="Search by name" />
  @if (loading$ | async) {
  <div>loading...</div>
  } @else {
  <div>{{ output }}</div>
  }
